VocalLE3 – Blog Application

This repository contains my work for **LE2** and **LE3** in IT128.  
The project is a simple blogging system built using C# (.NET), SQL Server LocalDB, and Dapper ORM.

Features
- Register User – create new accounts with username, password, and full name.
- Login – verify credentials to access the system.
- Add Post – create a new blog post (title and body).
- List Posts – show all blog posts with author and date created.
- View Post Details – display full content of a single blog post.
